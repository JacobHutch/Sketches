# Sketches
A collection of random code sketches.

**Format:**
Each sketch is in a folder labeled YYYY-MM-DD-NameOfSketch,
with the date being the day it was started.

The shared folder is separated by coding language, and has
files that are used in multiple sketches. Some files might
have an example file contained within the examples folder.
(FYI I don't use them that much)
> The file 'Shared/Python/Frame.py' has the counterpart
> 'Examples/Python/FrameExample.py'
Note: I don't really use it anymore

**Note:**
This repository is mostly for one-offs that I'll make in a day or week

and forget about, if a sketch seems worthy enough and I'm not lazy I might
make it into its own separate repository.

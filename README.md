# Sketches
A collection of random code sketches.

**Format:**
Each sketch is in a folder labeled YYYY-MM-DD-NameOfSketch,
with the date being the day it was started.

The shared folder is separated by coding language, and has
files that are used in multiple sketches. Some files might
have an example file contained within the examples folder.
> The file 'Shared/Python/Frame.py' has the counterpart
> 'Examples/Python/FrameExample.py'

<br>

**Note:**
This repository is mostly for one-offs that I'll make in a day or week
and forget about, if a sketch seems worthy enough it will be made in
its own separate repository.
